                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Moodscape tells time in an abstract form through color and motion instead of numbers. It reflects how time is experienced emotionally: slow when calm, fast and chaotic when anxious, and playful when happy. Each part of the day is represented by a different color/emotion, such as blue in the morning, yellow for happiness at noon, and alarming red at night. This project helped me rethink how time can reflect feelings and states of mind.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Time Data Access: Used p5.js functions like `hour()` and `minute()` to retrieve the computer's current time, which drives the color and motion changes of the MoodScape.</li>
                        <li>Value Mapping: Implemented the `map()` function to translate continuous time values (e.g., minutes 0–59) into visual properties, such as controlling the speed of motion or the brightness of a color component.</li>
                        <li>Cyclic Movement: Applied trigonometry (sine/cosine), coupled with `translate()` and `rotate()`, to generate the subtle, circular movements that visually express the passing time.</li>
