                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This was a collaborative drawing project where I blended three different artistic styles (Cinnamaroll's head, Ethan's drawing of a torso, and Lucas's drawing of legs) into a cohesive digital piece. Each drawing was coded using its own function, which allowed for precise positioning with `x` and `y` parameters. I included specific features like Doraemon's bell on the torso and added a random generator so the hair changes every time the sketch is played.
                </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Modular Programming: Implemented separate functions (e.g., `drawHead()`, `drawTorso()`, `drawLegs()`) for each section of the Exquisite Corpse, enabling precise placement and isolation of the different artists' styles.</li>
                        <li>Coordinate System Control: Utilized `x` and `y` parameters within the drawing functions to make each body segment modular and easily positioned, allowing them to be aligned accurately to create the final composite figure.</li>
                        <li>Conditional Randomness: Applied a `random()` function specifically to the hair element of the Cinnamoroll head to introduce an element of procedural variation while keeping the core drawing fixed.</li>
