                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Scribbl is an autobiographical game about a hand-drawn doodle that comes to life inside a sketchbook, embodying creativity and curiosity. Players guide Scribbl, who fears being erased and longs to create something meaningful, through three scenes: coloring a blank page, surviving a chaotic “scribble storm” of doubt, and finally exploring a vibrant world where they can draw freely. The simple movement, jumping, and interactive drawing mechanics conclude by reminding players that “everyone’s creative.”

                    <ul>
                        <li>Game Logic: Implemented a basic state machine pattern (likely using a `gameState` variable) to manage the transitions between the three major scenes (Coloring, Scribble Storm, Free Exploration).</li>
                        <li>Interactive Mechanics: Developed custom functions and conditional logic to handle core game interactions, including player movement (jumping, simple movement) and interactive drawing elements (allowing the user to draw on the page).</li>
                        <li>Collision/Boundary Detection: Used simple geometric calculations (e.g., distance or overlapping rectangles) to manage collision detection between the player character and environment objects (like obstacles in the 'scribble storm' scene).</li>
