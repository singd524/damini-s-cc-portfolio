                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This piece was developed for my Major Studio 1 course as part of the 5in5 project, exploring themes of nostalgia and time-based interaction. The interaction requires the user to press the different time buttons to reveal the final visual state except it shows an error when you try to access the present representing the thought that we don't live in the present anymore. 
                </p>
                <p>
his interaction is meant to reflect how digital systems constantly push us to relive past experiences or anticipate future ones, while offering no real space for living in the now. The glitching of the "Present" button symbolizes the breakdown of immediacy in a moderated world, where even the current moment is filtered, delayed, or archived before it can be fully experienced.                 </p>

                        <li>User Input: Implementing a mouse click to act as the "key" or "trigger" to change the state.</li>
                        <li>Time-Based Functions: Utilization of `millis()` or state variables to manage duration or time-out conditions.</li>
